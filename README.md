# Anchor for EVM Developers

I recently had an opportunity to work on a Solana project as a complete beginner. I am jumping into the project having a few years of EVM experience under my belt and it is a completely different paradigm. There are many resources out there to get you started with developing on Solana, but there is nothing that bridges your EVM knowledge to Solana. I hope this guide will help you to get started very quickly. This guide is inspired by [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/). It is going to be light on texts and heavy on code. Experienced EVM developers should be able to just read the code and click.
